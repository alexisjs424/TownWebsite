            <p> The Town of Broadalbin was part of the Sacandaga Patent of 1741. The town formed from the town of            Caughnawaga in northern Montgomery County. The town was first settled around 1770 near the present           Broadalbin village.</p>
    
            <p>Broadalbin was created from the towns of Johnstown and Mayfield in 1793, before Fulton County was formed.</p>

    <h2>Geography</h2>
    
  <p>The Town of Broadalbin is located along the eastern edge of Fulton County, at the south end of the Great Sacandaga Lake. The east town line is the border of Saratoga County. The Village of Broadalbin is on the western side of the town and extends west into the Town of Mayfield. The town is partially in the Adirondack Park.</p>
    
  <p>NY State Route 29 crosses the center of the town, leading east to Saratoga Springs and west to Johnstown, the Fulton County seat.</p>

  <p>The Village of Broadalbin is contained within the town. Other communities include: Beatty Corners, Benedict, Fish House, Gorthey Corners, Hill Corners, Hoesville, Honeywell Corners, Mills Corners, North Broadalbin, Sand Island, Steeles Corners, Stever Mill and Union Mills.</p>

  <h2>Economic Outlook</h2>
  <p>The Town of Broadalbin occupies a strategic location. Fulton County is located within New York’s “Technology Triangle” formed by Global Foundries to the east, SUNY Poly College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering to the south, and Marcy Nanocenter at SUNY Polytechnic Institute to the west.</p>

  <p>Fulton County’s Development Strategy calls for the implementation of what are referred to as Primary Development Areas. State Highway 29 runs through the Town of Broadalbin and intersects with State Highway 30 just west of the Town line. This Primary Development Area, called Vail Mills, offers premier opportunities for infill development fanning out from that intersection. It is a key gateway to the Great Sacandaga Lake and the Adirondack State Park.</p>

  <p>The concept plan provides new single-family housing, a commercial/retail district and lodgings in a pastoral setting. To that end Fulton County has worked with the Village of Broadalbin to add capacity to their plant and become a customer. The EDP has estimated that the sewer collection system for the Vail Mills Development Area could initially collect up to 50,000 gallons a day of wastewater flow. The intent is for projects/developers to extend sewer lines to projects located north, south, west and east through the Town of Broadalbin on either side of the Route 29 Corridor.</p>

  <p>With its beautiful landscapes, exceptional outdoor recreation and safe community, the Town of Broadalbin seeks to be an extraordinary place to live and is readying for that capacity...</p>
